-- Portfolio 3: safe fund transfer for Nexora. Safe to re-run (CREATE OR REPLACE).
-- transfer_funds() moves money between two wallets as ONE atomic unit:
--   * idempotent: a retried request (same key) is applied only once
--   * deadlock-safe: both wallets are locked in a fixed order (lowest account_id first)
--   * race-safe: balances are read AFTER the row locks are held
--   * double-entry: writes one DEBIT and one CREDIT ledger line
--   * all-or-nothing: any error rolls back the whole transfer, including the
--     transactions row that was registered at the start
-- Note: ledger timestamps use clock_timestamp() (real time), not now() (transaction
-- start time). Under concurrency, now() could order ledger lines wrongly.
